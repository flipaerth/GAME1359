This week, you'll add to the 3D platformer from the previous assignment by adding item pickups and multiple levels.

You'll need to add:
-Some sort of prefab that the player can pickup (a coin or something). When the player touches the item, it should disappear from the level. {DONE}
-A Game Manager that keeps track of how many items are left to pickup. {DONE}
-A second level that the player is transferred to once they've picked up all the items. {DONE}
-A "KillLine" or "KillZone" that will kill the player and restart the level if the player falls too low {DONE}
