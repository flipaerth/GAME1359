/*
Using the videos above as a reference, you are to use Unity/C# to build a simple 3D platformer
for this week's assignment; however, unlike in the video, also ensure that:

The character only jumps when touching the ground
(hint: raycasts, tags, and variables will help you here).

You include a variable, available in the Inspector,
to change the Player's move speed.

You don't need to worry about animations or level design
for this assignment - just a character that can move and jump.

Next week, we'll add stuff to improve on this :)
